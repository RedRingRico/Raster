# RASTER | README #
###################

OVERVIEW
Raster is a software renderer for MS DOS, FreeDOS, Linux, and Windows.  The
goal is to provide an API for rendering to a block of memory which will hold
the image data generated from polygons, textures, and materials provided by the
user.

For screen rendering, Xlib will be used for rendering into an OpenGL window on
Linux, an OpenGL Win32 window will be provided for Windows, and direct
rendering to the display device will occur on MS DOS and FreeDOS.
